        Their predators include
        dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The average life expectancy of a cuttlefish is
        <span class="tag">about</span> 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most
        intelligent invertebrates.[4]
        Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

        The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with
        the Old Norse <span class="tag">koddi</span> (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman
        world valued the
        cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The
        word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.

    <p class="post" >The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        shallow-water <a href="ss">animals</a> , although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10]
        They have an
        unusual biogeographic pattern: they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the
        Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the
        time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep
        for these warm-water species to cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
        Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are
        found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m
        (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of
        Threatened Species. This means that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in some
        regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them from being too
        threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the
        atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[13]</p>

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p class="post">Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities
        between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil
        is a smoothly curving W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they can perceive the
        polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor
        cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye
        changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the
        lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned
        behind the retina. They are capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their
        brain calculates the input from both eyes.[18][19]</p>

    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein
        haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.
        The blood is pumped by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills
        (one heart for each), and the third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow more
        rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin.
        Unlike most other mollusks, cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.</p>
