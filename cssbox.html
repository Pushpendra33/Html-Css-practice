        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs , crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The average life expectancy of a</div>


    <div id="two">cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most
        intelligent
        invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

    <div id="three">The cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be
        cognate with the
        Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish
        as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for
        it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.</div>
